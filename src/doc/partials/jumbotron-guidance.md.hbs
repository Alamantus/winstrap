* Do not put `.jumbotron` inside `.container` or `.container-fluid`. Instead, close the container before adding Jumbotron to the page, then follow it by opening a new container afterward if necessary. 
* You can use the `.jumbotron` and `.hero` classes interchangably. Microsoft sites call this component _Hero_ which is why the class is offered here.
